# Voice-Denoising-Using-FIR-IIR-Filtering-Techniques-in-MATLAB-
Designed a MATLAB-based noise removal system using a 4th-order Butterworth bandpass filter to eliminate background noise below 700 Hz. I performed FFT spectral analysis to isolate voice frequencies and successfully improved the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) from -13 dB to -9.16 dB.
